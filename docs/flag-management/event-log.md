# Flag Events Log

The Flag Events Log displays a table of actions performed on feature flags, ordered by most recent to least recent. This is useful if you would like to see the history of a feature flag. To see it, simply navigate to the “Flag Events Log” page via the left sidebar. Event types include “FLAG_CREATED”, “FLAG_DELETED”, “FLAG_TOGGLED”, and “FLAG_EDITED”. You can filter for events for a specific flag by selecting the name of your desired flag in the dropdown.
