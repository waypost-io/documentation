You will need to select at least one during creation, but you can edit which metrics you\u2019re applying at a later time if necessary. In order to have metrics to select from, you will need to first set up your metric definitions in the Metrics page on the Waypost-UI. There are four different types of metrics:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"experimentation/experimentation_guidelines":{"id":"experimentation/experimentation_guidelines","title":"General Experimentation Guidelines","description":"Before starting any experiment, it is important to know what you are doing so that you don\u2019t set it up incorrectly or get misled by results. Ideally there is a data scientist on the team who can help design experiments, but if there isn\u2019t, it\u2019s recommended that whoever is setting up the experiments has a good understanding of A/B testing first. A great book to help form an understanding is A Practical Guide to A/B Testing by Ron Kohavi, Diane Tang, and Ya Xu. However, there is also a plethora of free articles online that cover everything you would need to know about A/B testing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"experimentation/understanding_results":{"id":"experimentation/understanding_results","title":"Understanding the Results","description":"There are two main pieces of information you can view on the experiment: 1) the exposures over time, and 2) the statistics for each metric.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"flag-management/event-log":{"id":"flag-management/event-log","title":"Flag Events Log","description":"The Flag Events Log page, accessible via the left sidebar, displays a table of actions performed on feature flags, ordered by most recent to least recent. This is useful if you would like to see the history of a feature flag. Event types include \u201cFLAGCREATED\u201d, \u201cFLAGDELETED\u201d, \u201cFLAGTOGGLED\u201d, and \u201cFLAGEDITED\u201d.

Therefore, you will need to embed your SDK key when you instantiate the SDK client on your app. For increased security, it is recommended to keep the key as an environment variable rather than hard-coding it into your app.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"sdk/react-sdk":{"id":"sdk/react-sdk","title":"React SDK","description":"1.

The main difference between the two is that the client-side (React) SDK exports the additional objects WaypostContext and WaypostProvider , which use React Context. The WaypostProvider component takes the config (instance of the Config class) as an argument, and the SDK client is created inside of the component.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
